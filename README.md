# isEdible
python script to determine if {$string} is a food/drink or not.  Two versions are implemented: the first uses the Google Search API and can be run as Google Colab notebooks.  If the dataset is large enough, this can be quite expensive.  The second version uses a local lookup table derived from various recipe databases.  This version does not require payment, but performs around 20% less accurately.


The version that uses the Google Search API requires the following dependencies:
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install google
